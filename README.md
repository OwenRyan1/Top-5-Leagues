Hello, here is a little website I made. A couple of notes, make sure to have Flask installed and of course python/HTML. This is the first "full stack" project I have ever created. The API used is a free version with only 100 requests a minute allowed. This project has a little over 100; however, it has worked for me 9/10 times when running it. If it is not working simply comment out one or more of the 5 leagues and it will work. It was the best free sports API I could find for the complexity of the project. Anyway, enjoy!
