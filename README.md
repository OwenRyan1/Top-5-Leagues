Hello, here is a little website I made. Couple notes, make sure to have flask installed and of couse python/html. This is my "full stack" project I have ever created. The API used is a free version with only 100 requests a minute allowed. This project has a little over a 100; however, it has worked for me 9/10 times when running it. It was the best free sports API I could find for the complexity of the project. Anyway, enjoy!
